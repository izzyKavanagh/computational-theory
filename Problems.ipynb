    "###  Problem 3 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before hashing can begin, the message needs to be prepared in a specific way - everything needs to be the right size and format. This preparation has three steps, and we're focusing on the first two: padding and parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Padding the Message\n",
    "The goal: make the message length a specific multiple (either 512 bits or 1024 bits, depending on the SHA algorithm used).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For SHA-1, SHA-224, and SHA-256 (512-bit blocks):**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the message is ℓ bits long here's what happens:\n",
    "* Add a \"1\" bit to the end of your message\n",
    "* Add k zero bits, where k is chosen so that (ℓ + 1 + k) equals 448 when you divide by 512 and look at the remainder\n",
    "* Add a 64-bit representation of ℓ (the original message length)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The result: (ℓ + 1 + k + 64) is always 512 bits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parsing the Message\n",
    "\n",
    "Once padded, you need to break the message into chunks (blocks) for processing.\n",
    "For **SHA-256** and similar algorithms, you split your padded message into N blocks of 512 bits each. Each 512-bit block is then subdivided into sixteen 32-bit words (since 16 × 32 = 512).\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have block i, it contains words M₀⁽ⁱ⁾, M₁⁽ⁱ⁾, M₂⁽ⁱ⁾, ... M₁₅⁽ⁱ⁾."
