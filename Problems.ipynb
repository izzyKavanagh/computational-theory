All SHA-256 operations must use modulo 2^32 arithmetic to ensure consistent, reproducible hash values across all platforms and implementations- essentailly, all SHA operations must use unsigned 32-bit integers to produce correct hash values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Is Essential:** Python’s integers are unbounded by default, which would produce incorrect SHA-256 hashes. SHA-256 uses modulo 2^32 arithmetic for every operation which forces values into a 32-bit type. \n",

    "This function ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correct overflow behavior: Values wrap around at 2^32−1 (4,294,967,295)\n",
    "* Proper masking: All values stay within 32-bit bounds\n",
    "* Platform consistency: Same results on all systems\n",
    "* Specification compliance: Matches FIPS 180-4 requirements exactly\n",

Essentially, for any integer x, applying modulo 2^32 means computing: x mod 2^32, which gives the remainder after dividing x by 2^32. The result is always in the range: 0 ≤ x mod 2^32 < 2^32\n",

Essentially, the Parity function determines whether an odd or even number of bits are set at each bit position across three 32-bit inputs.\n",

The Ch() function chooses bits from either of the two input integers y and z, based on the value of input x. Essentially, this function uses x as a selector to choose bits from either y or z: \n",

    "* if a bit in x is 1, then the corresponding bit from y is chosen\n",
    "* if a bit in x is 0, then the corresponding bit from x is chosen.\n",

    "* First, AND compares each bit in both values being considered and only outputs 1 when both bits are 1. If only one bit is 1 or neither bits are 1, a 0 is output. Therefore where x has 1s, the corresponding bits from y are output, and where x has 0s, 0s are output. \n",
    "* Next, When performing the AND operation on x and z, the NOT operation is first used to flip all the bits in x (1→0, 0→1).

Therefore when XOR is applied, we get a binary number which shows which bits are different the results of both AND operations performed on x y and x z. However, due to the face that NOT was applied when calculating the result of x and z, but not when calculating the result of x and y, this results in the outputs of these operations being mutually exlusive - there is no overalp between the two: each result has 1s where the other has 0s and vice versa.

    "#### **rotr(x, n)** — Right Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** perform a right rotation on a 32-bit value. rort(x, n) rotates bits instead of shifting in zeros which isn a core operation in SHA-256’s mixing steps. rotr(x, n) is different from a logical shift because instead of bits being dropped once they go out of range, the rotation wraps around the dropped bits and adds them back onto the beginning of the vale. This preserves all bit information while performing a diffusion to improve encryption, which is the main function of rotr(x, n). Rotations are a core building block of the **Σ** and **σ** functions (implemented later in this section), so this helper function rotr(x, n) (shown below) implements rotations to facilitate these functions.\n",

    "## Problem 2 Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how the functions from Problem 1 work in the SHA-256 compression function. What other aspects are there to the compression function? This is the subject of Problem 2: Implementing functions which generate the 64 constant values (K₀ through K₆₃) used in the SHA-256, as defined in the Secure Hash Standard. SHA-256 operates on 32-bit words and relies on round constants (K0–K63) in order to ensure maximum diffusion and unpredictability so there are no patterns that attackers could exploit and no hidden weaknesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic constants must be verifiable to earn trust, unpredictable-looking to prevent structural weaknesses, and free from suspicion to ensure confidence in the algorithm. In order to achieve this, cube roots of primes are used because they are a trustworthy source of “random-looking” values that cannot be secretly manipulate.\n",
    "* Primes are neutral: They are well-known, fixed numbers with no hidden structure. Anyone can verify which primes are used.\n",
    "* Cube roots look random: Taking the cube root of a prime produces an irrational number with no repeating pattern, so its bits don’t follow predictable rules.\n",
    "* Fractional parts mix well: The decimal part of these cube roots appears random, making it ideal for spreading small input changes across many bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the process is public and deterministic, it is verifiable that the constants weren’t selected in order to hide weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 64 constants (K0–K63) are derived using the formula: **∛(pᵢ)** \n",
    "\n",
    "Where: pᵢ is the i-th prime number (p₀=2, p₁=3, p₂=5, ..., p₆₃=311) and ∛ denotes cube root\n",
    "\n",
    "From the result of ∛(pᵢ), the fractional part is extracted (digits after the decimal point), and from that fractional part the first 32 bits are extracted and converted into hexidecimal. This process is repeated for each of the first 64 prime numbers, giving us the 64 constants K0–K63.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this logic and calculate these constants, we have implemented four different functions to break down the process into simple steps. These four function are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* primes(n): gets the first 64 prime numbers\n",
    "* cube_roots(primes): calculates the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why in SHA-256:** Using the fractional part ensures a uniform, non-repeating bit pattern for cryptographic mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This function implements the third and final step in the process for generating SHA-256's 64 round constants by extracting the first 32 bits of the fractional part of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers calculated by the cube_roots(primes) function. Essentially, this function utilises the functions implemented previously (primes(n), cube_roots(primes)) to generate the 64 K constants, each of which are used in a round of SHA-256's compression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function frac_32() extracts the fractional part of the cube roots using np.modf() by returning the value of a floating point value split into two parts: (fractional, integer). Next, the frac_32() function scales the fractional part to 32 bits and applies NumPy's floor() function to round each fractional value down to the nearest integer which ensures no rounding up occurs as this could change bit patterns and produce incorrect constants. Finally the 32-bit fractional part is cast to an unsigned 32-bit integer using NumPy's uint32 data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function frac_32() implements this logic using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Call the primes(n) function to generate the first 64 prime numbers\n",
    "* Step 2: Call the cube_roots(primes) function to calculate the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers\n",
    "* Step 3: Split each cube root into its fractional part and integer part using NumPy's modf() function. The fractional parts are stored in \"frac\" while the integer parts are disgarded using a blank variable \"_\". \n",
    "* Step 4: The fractional parts are scaled, meaning the first 32 bits of each fractional part are extracted by using modulo 2^32 on the \"frac\" variable\n",
    "* Step 5: Remove any remaining fractional bits from the values in \"frac\" using NumPy's floor() function\n",
    "* Step 6: Convert the frac variables to 32-bit unsigned integers by using NumPy's uint32 data type\n",
    "* Step 7: Returns a NumPy array containing the 64 constants derived from the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers, stored as unsigned 32-bit integers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in SHA-256**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 64 K constants, as defined in SHA-256, are added to the working variables in each round of the SHA-256 compression function:\n",
    "\n",
    "In round t (0 ≤ t ≤ 63): **T1 = h + Σ₁(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + K[t] + W[t]**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round uses a different constant K[t] to prevent patterns/symmetries in the algorithm, ensure each round has unique behavior, and maximise diffusion across all 64 rounds, which overall enhances security.\n",

    "###  Problem 3 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the SHA-256 compression function can process a message, it must be prepared in a specific way - everything needs to be the right size and format. This section details the first two aspects of this preprocessing: padding and parsing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To give some context, the SHA-256 compression function can process input data in fixed-size chunks of 512 bits called blocks, but messages often arrive in unpredictable/inconsistent lengths. Therefore all messages need to be processed and converted into a format that the SHA-256 compression function can read: blocks of 512 bits. To achieve this, there a two main steps to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Padding the message: extend the message to a specific length by padding with k 0s (Section 5.1.1)\n",
    "* Parsing the message: divide the padded message into fixed-size (512 bits) blocks (Section 5.2.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance** \n",
    "\n",
    "These two stages are essential parts of the compression function process, and are needed for the following reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Needed for processing: Without this, short message couldn't be processed and long messages couldn't be divided uniformly, rendering the compression function ineffective. It ensures every block is exactly 512 bits\n",
    "* Ensures clear message representation: This guarantees that different messages never produce the same result after padding. \n",
    "* Encoding message length: Ensures the original length of the message is embedded into the padded data, which makes it bound to itself and preventing attacker from appending data and computing a valid hash. \n",
    "* Remains deterministic: The same message will always recieve the same padding and therefore produce the same hash. This ensures that all SHA-256 implementations are consistent/reproducible. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Padding:** Make the message length a specific multiple of 512 bits by applying the following process to a message that is l bits long:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add a \"1\" bit to the end of your message\n",
    "* Add k zero bits, where k is chosen so that (l + 1 + k) equals 448 when you divide by 512 and look at the remainder\n",
    "* Add a 64-bit representation of l (the original message length)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parsing:** Once padded, the message is broken down into n chunks (blocks) of 512 bits. Each 512-bit block is then subdivided into sixteen 32-bit words as: ***16 × 32 = 512***, meaning that each block i contains words: M₀⁽ⁱ⁾, M₁⁽ⁱ⁾, M₂⁽ⁱ⁾, ... M₁₅⁽ⁱ⁾.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve padding and parsing, this section implements four functions which help in this process: \n",
    " \n",
    "* file_parse(): Converts a message into bits\n",
    "* calculate_padding_length(message_length_bytes): Calculates the padding needed for a message\n",
    "* create_padding_block(partial_block, message_length_bits): Apply the calculated padding to the message\n",
    "* block_parse(msg): Parse the padded message by dividing it into n blocks of exactly 512 bits each"

    "**Purpose:** This function reads in a file in binary mode and returns its contents as a bytes object. This ensures that the message is in the right format for the rest of the preprocessing stage to work correctly. \n",
    "Binary mode is used because it reads exact bytes without interpretation which avoids any text mode issues such as encoding issues, altered line endings, and only successfully processing text files. The benefits of binary mode are as follows:\n",

This is a python function that ensures resources are managed safely and automatically, i.e. no need to close a file explicitly, the context manager does it for you. The file is then read in binary mode by using 'rb' where r = read and b = binary. Once everything is read, the bytes contained in the file are returned. The file_parse(filepath) function uses the following steps to implement this logic:\n",

    "This function implements the message parsing stage as described in section 5.2.1 of the Secure Hash Standardand and is responsible for splitting the input message into complete 512-bit (64-byte) blocks and apply SHA-256 padding to them using the create_padded_blocks() helper function. Each block is then yielded one at a time, ready for the SHA-256 compression function. This function is implemented as a Python generator, meaning it uses python's 'yield' statement to produce values on demande instead of returning a full list after all processing is complete, which makes it very efficient for large messages. This mirrors how cryptographic hash functions operate on streams of data, as they must process data as it arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation** \n",
    "\n",
    "To correctly split the input message into 64-byte blocks, the yield_blocks(msg, no_bytes) function uses a while loop to iterate through a message in increments of 64 bytes. Before the loop, two variables are initialised: \n",
    "\n",
    "* BLOCK_SIZE: initialised to the block size processed by SHA-256: 64 bytes. \n",
    "* A pointer variable 'position': which tracks the current position in the message. Essentially, it tracks how many bytes of the message have been processed so far, and increases in increments of 64 (BLOCK_SIZE). \n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop yields full blocks only. It does this by using a condition which ensures that only blocks that are exactly 64 bytes long are yielded. This is done by adding together the 'position' pointer (bytes) and the expected size of the next block 'BLOCK_SIZE' (64 bytes), and checking the result against the total length of the message (bytes). By doing this, the loop checks if the next block is a partial block. \n",

    "* If the loop condition is satisfied, then the 64 bytes of the message at the current position are yielded to the caller, and the position is incremented by 64 bytes (BLOCK_SIZE)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the loop condition is nto satisfied, i.e. the addition of position + BLOCK_SIZE exceeds the message length, that means that the next block is less than 64 bytes long and therefore a partial block. In this case, the loop ends and the current block is not yielded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the while loop is broken, it updates a variable partial_block with the position of that partial block in the message. Next, processing is delegated to another generator for padding: the creat_padded_blocks() function. Python's 'yield from' statement is used to iterate over all values produced by create_padded_blocks, and then yield each padded block as if it were yielded directly by block_parse. This means the caller sees a single continuous stream of blocks: both complete blocks and padded blocks in a single continuous sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Initialise the BLOCK_SIZE to 64 bytes and message_length_bits to the total message length calculated in bits (required for SHA-256 padding)\n",
    "* Step 2: Initialise the position pointer to 0 \n",
    "* Step 3: Enter the parsing loop by checking whether position + BLOCK_SIZE is less than or equal to the total message length (in bytes), to guarantees that the next slice will be exactly 64 bytes long.\n",
    "* Step 4: Yield a complete 64-byte block of the message using python's yield. At this point, the function pauses execution and hands the block to the caller, and resumes when the next block is requested.\n",
    "* Step 5: Increment the position pointer by 64 bytes in preparation for the next iteration.\n",

    "* Step 7: Extract and store any remaining bytes in partial_block. This may be empty (if the message length is a multiple of 64\n",
