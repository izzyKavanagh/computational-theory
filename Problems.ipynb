    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presents a complete, step by step implementation of the SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) cryptographic hash function, following the specifications detailed in FIPS PUB 180-4 (Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 180-4), the official Secure Hash Standard published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\n",
    "Rather than treating SHA-256 as a black box or relying on existing library implementations, this project systematically builds the algorithm from its most fundamental components—individual bitwise operations—up through the complete hash computation pipeline, ultimately demonstrating both the power and limitations of cryptographic hashing in real-world security applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose and Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic algorithms are often used without a deep understanding of their internal mechanisms. This project addresses that gap by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Demystifying cryptography: Breaking down a complex, industry-standard algorithm into understandable components\n",
    "2. Understanding security properties: Revealing why specific design choices create cryptographic strength\n",
    "3. Demonstrating practical implementation: showing how mathematical specifications translate into working code\n",
    "3. Providing security awareness: Showing both proper and improper uses of cryptographic primitives\n",
    "4. Educational depth: Providing a complete learning path from theory to practice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world significance** \n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256 is not only an academic exercise — it is fundamental to modern digital security and is commonly implemented in the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blockchain and Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies use SHA-256 for proof-of-work\n",
    "* Digital Signatures: RSA-SHA256 and ECDSA-SHA256 authenticate software, documents, and communications\n",
    "* TLS/SSL: HTTPS connections use SHA-256 in certificate verification and key derivation\n",
    "* Data Integrity: File verification, backup validation, and tamper detection\n",
    "* Password Hashing: While SHA-256 alone is insufficient (as we'll demonstrate), it's a component in proper password hashing schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly cover all aspects of the SHA-256 algorithm, this notebook is divided into five sections: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Section 1 covers the fundamental operations that SHA-256 requires such as Maj, Ch, and the Sigma/sigma functions. \n",
    "* Section 2 covers the generation of cryptographic K constants (K₀–K₆₃) which are used in SHA-256's compression function. \n",
    "* Section 3 covers message preprocessing, which ensures that a message can be correctly processed by SHA-256. \n",
    "* Section 4 covers SHA-256's main implementation and performs the actual cryptographic transformation. \n",
    "* Section 5 covers a security analysis via a password cracking demonstration, utilising the SHA-256 lagorithm implemented in previous sections.\n",
    "* And finally a conclusion covers the findings and reflections of this project."

All SHA-256 operations must use modulo 2^32 arithmetic to ensure consistent, reproducible hash values across all platforms and implementations- essentially, all SHA operations must use unsigned 32-bit integers to produce correct hash values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Is Essential:** Python’s integers are unbounded by default, which would produce incorrect SHA-256 hashes. SHA-256 uses modulo 2^32 arithmetic for every operation which forces values into a 32-bit type. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correct overflow behavior: Values wrap around at 2^32−1 (4,294,967,295)\n",
    "* Proper masking: All values stay within 32-bit bounds\n",
    "* Platform consistency: Same results on all systems\n",
    "* Specification compliance: Matches FIPS 180-4 requirements exactly\n",

    "This function is the foundation of all SHA-256 operations:\n",

    "* exactly 32 bits wide\n",

    "\n",
    "As described in NumPy's official documentation, uint32 stores exactly 32 bits, meaning it can represent values from 0 to 2^32−1 (4,294,967,295). NumPy ensures that a value x is in the representable range (a 32-bit unsigned integer) by applying modulo 2^32 arithmetic, which means forcing a number to fit into 32 bits by keeping only its lowest 32 bits if the value goes out of range (i.e. once x goes past 2^32 − 1). Essentially, for any integer x, applying modulo 2^32 means computing: x mod 2^32, which gives the remainder after dividing x by 2^32. The result is always in the range: 0 ≤ x mod 2^32 < 2^32\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific cases:\n",
    "* If x is a negative value: NumPy applies modulo 2^32 wrapping. −1 wraps to 2^32 − 1 (4,294,967,295)\n",

Essentially, the Parity function determines whether an odd or even number of bits are set at each bit position across three 32-bit inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each bit position:\n",

    "* Output is 1 if an odd number (1 or 3) of inputs have 1\n",

Parity(x, y, z) applies the XOR operation twice as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: XOR compares corresponding bits of x and y: Outputs 1 if bits differ (one 1, one 0), and outputs 0 if bits match (both 0 or both 1). This result represents partial parity for x and y: Bit is 0 -> even number of 1s (0 or 2), Bit is 1 -> odd number of 1s (1)\n",

    "* Next, When performing the AND operation on x and z, the NOT operation is first used to flip all the bits in x (1→0, 0→1). When AND is performed on (NOT)x and z, the bits where x originally had 0s (now 1s) outputs the corresponding bits of z, and the bits where x originally had 1s (now 0s) outputs 0s. \n",
    "* Finally, the XOR bitwise operation is performed on the resulting values of x AND y, and (NOT)x and z. XOR is used to compare two values by outputing 1 when bits are different. Therefore when XOR is applied, we get a binary number which shows which bits are different the results of both AND operations performed on x y and x z. However, due to the fact that NOT was applied when calculating the result of x and z, but not when calculating the result of x and y, this results in the outputs of these operations being mutually exclusive - there is no overlap between the two: each result has 1s where the other has 0s and vice versa.

This preserves all bit information while performing a diffusion to improve encryption, which is the main function of rotr(x, n).

    "### **Problem 2 Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how the functions from Problem 1 work in the SHA-256 compression function. What other aspects are there to the compression function? This is the subject of Problem 2: Implementing functions which generate the 64 constant values (K₀ through K₆₃) used in the SHA-256, as defined in the Secure Hash Standard. SHA-256 operates on 32-bit words and relies on round constants (K0–K63) in order to ensure maximum diffusion and unpredictability so there are no patterns that attackers could exploit and no hidden weaknesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic constants must be verifiable to earn trust, unpredictable-looking to prevent structural weaknesses, and free from suspicion to ensure confidence in the algorithm. In order to achieve this, cube roots of primes are used because they are a trustworthy source of “random-looking” values that cannot be secretly manipulate.\n",
    "* Primes are neutral: They are well-known, fixed numbers with no hidden structure. Anyone can verify which primes are used.\n",
    "* Cube roots look random: Taking the cube root of a prime produces an irrational number with no repeating pattern, so its bits don’t follow predictable rules.\n",
    "* Fractional parts mix well: The decimal part of these cube roots appears random, making it ideal for spreading small input changes across many bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the process is public and deterministic, it is verifiable that the constants weren’t selected in order to hide weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 64 constants (K0–K63) are derived using the formula: **∛(pᵢ)** \n",
    "\n",
    "Where: pᵢ is the i-th prime number (p₀=2, p₁=3, p₂=5, ..., p₆₃=311) and ∛ denotes cube root\n",
    "\n",
    "From the result of ∛(pᵢ), the fractional part is extracted (digits after the decimal point), and from that fractional part the first 32 bits are extracted and converted into hexidecimal. This process is repeated for each of the first 64 prime numbers, giving us the 64 constants K0–K63.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this logic and calculate these constants, we have implemented four different functions to break down the process into simple steps. These four function are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* primes(n): gets the first 64 prime numbers\n",
    "* cube_roots(primes): calculates the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers\n",
    "* frac_32(): gets the fractional part of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers\n",

    "**Purpose:** This function implements the third and final step in the process for generating SHA-256's 64 round constants by extracting the first 32 bits of the fractional part of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers calculated by the cube_roots(primes) function. Essentially, this function utilises the functions implemented previously (primes(n), cube_roots(primes)) to generate the 64 K constants, each of which are used in a round of SHA-256's compression function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function frac_32() extracts the fractional part of the cube roots using np.modf() by returning the value of a floating point value split into two parts: (fractional, integer). Next, the frac_32() function scales the fractional part to 32 bits and applies NumPy's floor() function to round each fractional value down to the nearest integer which ensures no rounding up occurs as this could change bit patterns and produce incorrect constants. Finally the 32-bit fractional part is cast to an unsigned 32-bit integer using NumPy's uint32 data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function frac_32() implements this logic using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Call the primes(n) function to generate the first 64 prime numbers\n",
    "* Step 2: Call the cube_roots(primes) function to calculate the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers\n",
    "* Step 3: Split each cube root into its fractional part and integer part using NumPy's modf() function. The fractional parts are stored in \"frac\" while the integer parts are disgarded using a blank variable \"_\". \n",
    "* Step 4: The fractional parts are scaled, meaning the first 32 bits of each fractional part are extracted by using modulo 2^32 on the \"frac\" variable\n",
    "* Step 5: Remove any remaining fractional bits from the values in \"frac\" using NumPy's floor() function\n",
    "* Step 6: Convert the frac variables to 32-bit unsigned integers by using NumPy's uint32 data type\n",
    "* Step 7: Returns a NumPy array containing the 64 constants derived from the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers, stored as unsigned 32-bit integers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in SHA-256**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 64 K constants, as defined in SHA-256, are added to the working variables in each round of the SHA-256 compression function:\n",
    "\n",
    "In round t (0 ≤ t ≤ 63): **T1 = h + Σ₁(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + K[t] + W[t]**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round uses a different constant K[t] to prevent patterns/symmetries in the algorithm, ensure each round has unique behavior, and maximise diffusion across all 64 rounds, which overall enhances security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relation to other functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The frac_32() function generates the 64 K constants by utilising the cube_roots(primes) function to generate the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers, provided by the primes(n) function."

    "Before the SHA-256 compression function can process a message, it must be prepared in a specific way - everything needs to be the right size and format. This section details the first two aspects of this preprocessing: padding and parsing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To give some context, the SHA-256 compression function can process input data in fixed-size chunks of 512 bits called blocks, but messages often arrive in unpredictable/inconsistent lengths. Therefore all messages need to be processed and converted into a format that the SHA-256 compression function can read: blocks of 512 bits. To achieve this, there a two main steps to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Padding the message: extend the message to a specific length by padding with k 0s (Section 5.1.1)\n",
    "* Parsing the message: divide the padded message into fixed-size (512 bits) blocks (Section 5.2.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance** \n",
    "\n",
    "These two stages are essential parts of the compression function process, and are needed for the following reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Needed for processing: Without this, short messages couldn't be processed and long messages couldn't be divided uniformly, rendering the compression function ineffective. It ensures every block is exactly 512 bits\n",
    "* Ensures clear message representation: This guarantees that different messages never produce the same result after padding. \n",
    "* Encoding message length: Ensures the original length of the message is embedded into the padded data, which makes it bound to itself and preventing attacker from appending data and computing a valid hash. \n",
    "* Remains deterministic: The same message will always recieve the same padding and therefore produce the same hash. This ensures that all SHA-256 implementations are consistent/reproducible. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Padding:** Make the message length a specific multiple of 512 bits by applying the following process to a message that is l bits long:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add a \"1\" bit to the end of your message\n",
    "* Add k zero bits, where k is chosen so that (l + 1 + k) equals 448 when you divide by 512 and look at the remainder\n",
    "* Add a 64-bit representation of l (the original message length)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parsing:** Once padded, the message is broken down into n chunks (blocks) of 512 bits. Each 512-bit block is then subdivided into sixteen 32-bit words as: ***16 × 32 = 512***, meaning that each block i contains words: M₀⁽ⁱ⁾, M₁⁽ⁱ⁾, M₂⁽ⁱ⁾, ... M₁₅⁽ⁱ⁾.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve padding and parsing, this section implements four functions which help in this process: \n",
    " \n",
    "* file_parse(): Converts a message into bits\n",
    "* calculate_padding_length(message_length_bytes): Calculates the padding needed for a message\n",
    "* create_padding_block(partial_block, message_length_bits): Apply the calculated padding to the message\n",
    "* block_parse(msg): Parse the padded message by dividing it into n blocks of exactly 512 bits each"

    "### **file_parse(filepath) function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This function reads in a file in binary mode and returns its contents as a bytes object. This ensures that the message is in the right format for the rest of the preprocessing stage to work correctly. \n",
    "Binary mode is used because it reads exact bytes without interpretation which avoids any text mode issues such as encoding issues, altered line endings, and only successfully processing text files. The benefits of binary mode are as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The file_parse(filepath) function implements the logic described above by taking in a filepath as input, and opening the file using python's context manager - 'with'. This is a python function that ensures resources are managed safely and automatically, i.e. no need to close a file explicitly, the context manager does it for you. The file is then read in binary mode by using 'rb' where r = read and b = binary. Once everything is read, the bytes contained in the file are returned. The file_parse(filepath) function uses the following steps to implement this logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Read in the filepath\n",
    "* Step 2: Open the file using python's context manager 'with'\n",

    "* Step 5: Return stored bytes \n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in SHA-256**\n",

    "SHA-256 operates on raw bytes, not text, therefore all messages must be converted to/read as bytes. This makes the file conversion function file_parse(filepath) an essential step in the preprocessing stage.\n",

    "This function implements the message parsing stage as described in section 5.2.1 of the Secure Hash Standardand and is responsible for splitting the input message into complete 512-bit (64-byte) blocks and apply SHA-256 padding to them using the create_padded_blocks() helper function. Each block is then yielded one at a time, ready for the SHA-256 compression function. This function is implemented as a Python generator, meaning it uses python's 'yield' statement to produce values on demande instead of returning a full list after all processing is complete, which makes it very efficient for large messages. This mirrors how cryptographic hash functions operate on streams of data, as they must process data as it arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation** \n",
    "\n",
    "To correctly split the input message into 64-byte blocks, the yield_blocks(msg, no_bytes) function uses a while loop to iterate through a message in increments of 64 bytes. Before the loop, two variables are initialised: \n",
    "\n",
    "* BLOCK_SIZE: initialised to the block size processed by SHA-256: 64 bytes. \n",
    "* A pointer variable 'position': which tracks the current position in the message. Essentially, it tracks how many bytes of the message have been processed so far, and increases in increments of 64 (BLOCK_SIZE). \n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop yields full blocks only. It does this by using a condition which ensures that only blocks that are exactly 64 bytes long are yielded. This is done by adding together the 'position' pointer (bytes) and the expected size of the next block 'BLOCK_SIZE' (64 bytes), and checking the result against the total length of the message (bytes). By doing this, the loop checks if the next block is a partial block. \n",

    "* If the loop condition is satisfied, then the 64 bytes of the message at the current position are yielded to the caller, and the position is incremented by 64 bytes (BLOCK_SIZE)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the loop condition is not satisfied, i.e. the addition of position + BLOCK_SIZE exceeds the message length, that means that the next block is less than 64 bytes long and therefore a partial block. In this case, the loop ends and the current block is not yielded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the while loop is broken, it updates a variable partial_block with the position of that partial block in the message. Next, processing is delegated to another generator for padding: the create_padded_blocks() function. Python's 'yield from' statement is used to iterate over all values produced by create_padded_blocks, and then yield each padded block as if it were yielded directly by block_parse. This means the caller sees a single continuous stream of blocks: both complete blocks and padded blocks in a single continuous sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Initialise the BLOCK_SIZE to 64 bytes and message_length_bits to the total message length calculated in bits (required for SHA-256 padding)\n",
    "* Step 2: Initialise the position pointer to 0 \n",
    "* Step 3: Enter the parsing loop by checking whether position + BLOCK_SIZE is less than or equal to the total message length (in bytes), to guarantees that the next slice will be exactly 64 bytes long.\n",
    "* Step 4: Yield a complete 64-byte block of the message using python's yield. At this point, the function pauses execution and hands the block to the caller, and resumes when the next block is requested.\n",

    "* Step 7: Extract and store any remaining bytes in partial_block. This may be empty (if the message length is a multiple of 64\n",
    "* Step 8: Delegate padding to a helper generator by passing the remaining bytes and message length to create_padded_blocks(). Python’s yield from statement is used to yield all padded blocks produced by the helper generator create_padded_blocks() as part of the same output sequence.\n",

    "### **Introduction Problem 4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Problem 3, we covered how SHA-256 performs its core compression operations. Problem 4 builds on this by implementing the higher-level orchestration required to compute the hash for an entire message. Specifically, it covers the process of preparing the message, expanding it into a message schedule, initializing working variables, performing 64 rounds of compression, and combining the results into the evolving hash state, as defined in the Secure Hash Standard Section 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256 is a block-based hash function: it takes an input message of arbitrary length, divides it into fixed 512-bit blocks, and processes each block sequentially. To maintain cryptographic security, every bit of each message block must influence the final hash. Problem 4 ensures this through several carefully designed steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Message schedule expansion: Each 512-bit block is split into 16 initial 32-bit words, which are then expanded to a 64-word message schedule. This ensures that information from the block affects all 64 rounds of compression\n",
    "* Working Variables Initialisation: Eight 32-bit working variables are initialised from the current hash value. These variables evolve through 64 rounds of non-linear operations and bit mixing\n",
    "* 64 Rounds of Compression: Using the message schedule, the round constants, and SHA-256 functions (Ch, Maj, Σ₀, Σ₁), the working variables are iteratively updated, propagating the influence of each bit through the hash state\n",
    "* Hash State Update: After processing each block, the updated working variables are added to the current hash value to produce the intermediate hash. This chaining ensures that all blocks contribute to the final output\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these steps, Problem 4 produces a secure, deterministic, and irreversible hash value for any message. Five functions were implemented break down this process into manageable operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* expand_message_schedule(block) – Expands 16 message words into 64 words for compression\n",
    "* initialise_working_variables(current_hash) – Sets up the working state from the current hash\n",
    "* compress(working_vars, W, K) – Performs 64 rounds of SHA-256 compression using the message schedule and constants\n",
    "* sha256_hash_block(current_hash, block) – Orchestrates the expansion, initialisation, and compression for a single block\n",
    "* sha256(message) – Processes all blocks and returns the final 256-bit hash as a hexadecimal string\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure mirrors the SHA-256 specification in FIPS 180-4, making it clear how each stage contributes to the security, diffusion, and one-way nature of the algorithm."

Each value is the first 32 bits of the fractional part of the square root of one of the first eight prime numbers. These numbers ensure transparency and prevent the introduction of hidden structures. All compliant SHA-256 implementations MUST use these exact values. The constants are stored as unsigned 32-bit integers to enforce arithmetic modulo 2³² throughout the algorithm."

    "\n",
    "**Purpose** \n",
    "\n",
    "This function implements the message schedule expansion as defined in FIPS 180-4 Section 6.2.2. At this point in the SHA-256 process, the input message has been padded and divided into fixed-size 512-bit blocks by the functions defined in section 3 of this document. The compression function processes each block of the message and uses it to update the internal hash state by combining the current message block with the existing intermediate hash values. \n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256 performs 64 rounds of compression, but each 512-bit block of the message only contains 16 words (32 bits each). This function expands those 16 words into 64 words, which ensures that information from the message block influences all 64 rounds of the compression function, rather than only the first 16 rounds. The first 16 words come directly from the message block, and the remaining 48 words are generated using the sigma0 and sigma1 functions to create thorough mixing of the input bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expansion formula ensures that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each input word influences multiple rounds\n",
    "* Bits are mixed thoroughly via sigma0 and sigma1\n",
    "* The avalanche effect propagates through all rounds\n",
    "* Small message changes affect the entire schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "**Endianness:** Endianness defines the order in which bytes are arranged within a multi-byte word. In big-endian, the most significant byte (the “big end”) comes first, while in little-endian, the least significant byte comes first. SHA-256 requires big-endian interpretation of message blocks, meaning the first byte of each 32-bit word is the most significant. This matters because the hash computation operates on 32-bit words, so interpreting the bytes in the wrong order (little-endian) would produce different word values, causing the resulting hash to be incorrect. In Python, this is ensured when reading the block with np.frombuffer(block, dtype='>u4'), where > specifies big-endian 32-bit unsigned integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The expand_message_schedule() function ensures that every bit of the message eventually affects all rounds of the hash computation. To do this, it first interprets a message block as 16 'words' by dividing the 512-bit input block into 16 32-bit (4-byte) unsigned integers. This is done using np.frombuffer(block, dtype='>u4'), which reads the message block as consecutive 4-byte segments 'u4' interpreted as big-endian integers using '>'. These 16 'words' are stored in block_words and form the first part of the message schedule (W[0..15]). \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step in the message schedule expansion is to create an array 'W' to hold all 64 words of the schedule, which is done using NumPy's zeroes() function to create an array of 64 elements, all set to zero. Then the first 16 words in block_words are copied into the message schedule array 'W'.\n",
    "The next step is to compute the remaining 48 words of the schedule, from W[16] to W[63], using the current 16 words stored in 'W' and the SHA-256 sigma functions. A loop iterates over indices 16 to 63, where for each index t, the value of W[t] is calculated by applying the sum of the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* sigma1(W[t-2]): the sigma1 function (defined in section 1)  is applied to the word two positions before t, which applies shift and rotations to mix the bits of W[t-2] in a complex way.\n",
    "* W[t-7]: the word seven positions before t is added without modification. This step propagates information from earlier message words further into the schedule, ensuring that each original message word affects multiple rounds of the compression function.\n",
    "* sigma0(W[t-15]): – the sigma0 function (defined in section 1) is applied to the word fifteen positions before t. Like sigma1, this function applies rotations and shifts to spread the influence of older words across the schedule which contributes to diffusion.\n",
    "* W[t-16]: the word sixteen positions before t is added directly. This incorporates even older message content, making sure that all 16 original message words continue to influence the schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of these four components is implicitly modulo 2^32 because the W array has dtype np.uint32. This step ensures that any overflow wraps around, maintaining the fixed 32-bit word size. The results of all these operation are added together to produce a new 32-bit unsigned integer which is added to the array of word 'W'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the loop terminates, and 'W' has been populated with an additional 48 32-bit undigned integers, 'W' now constitutes the full message schedule array of 64 words. It is returned and will later be used in the compression function, with each word W[t] contributing to one round.\n",
    "\n",
    "This expand_message_schedule() function implements these steps in the following way: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Take the 512-bit block – Split it into 16 small pieces called words, each 32 bits (4 bytes) long\n",
    "* Step 2: Create a schedule array – Make an empty array W with 64 spots to hold all the words for the hash computation.\n",
    "* Step 3: Copy the first 16 words – Put the 16 original message words into the first 16 positions of W.\n",
    "* Step 4: Compute the remaining 48 words – For each position from 16 to 63: Look at the words at positions t-2, t-7, t-15, and t-16 and apply sigma0 and sigma1 to t-2 and t-15. \n",
    "* Step 5: Add all four words together (wrapping around if the sum exceeds 32 bits) and store the result in W[t].\n",
    "* Step 6: Return the full schedule (W) of 64 words\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in SHA-256**\n",
    "\n",
    "The expand_message_schedule(block) function is called once per 512-bit message block during the SHA-256 hash computation. Its output, the 64-word array W, is used directly in the compression function: each word W[t] is added during round t of the 64-round transformation.\n",

At this stage, the padded message has been split into 512-bit blocks, and a message schedule W has been prepared. The compression function takes the current working variables (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) and iteratively mixes them with the message schedule W and round constants K over 64 rounds.

By sequentially processing all blocks with this function, the SHA-256 algorithm builds a final 256-bit hash that is deterministic, irreversible, and collision-resistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function guarantees:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every block influences the hash through a complex, non-linear transformation\n",
    "* Earlier blocks propagate their effect to later blocks via the working variables and chaining mechanism\n",
    "* The avalanche effect ensures that a single-bit change in the message results in a completely different hash\n",
    "* The output depends on every bit of the input message and is suitable for cryptographic purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sha256_hash_block() function computes the new intermediate hash by first taking in the current hash calculated by the compress() function, as well as the next block of the message. Next, the function computes the message schedule 'W' by calling the expand_message_schedule() function defined previously in this section. The working variables are then initialised using the initialise_working_variables() function (defined previously), and these variables are input into the compress() (defined previously) to obtain the next set of working variables after 64 rounds of compression. Next, this function computes the new intermediate hash value by adding the final working variables (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) to the corresponding words of current_hash, and storing these resulting values in a uint32 array which is then returned. The sha256_hash_block() function implements these steps in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Expand the message schedule\n",
    "* Step 2: Initialise the working variables\n",
    "* Step 3: Perform 64 rounds of compression\n",
    "* Step 4: Compute the new intermediate hash value \n",
    "* Step 5: Return the new intermediate hash value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in SHA-256**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is the heart of SHA-256. It takes the current hash state and a message block, and produces an updated hash state that incorporates the information from that block. By processing all blocks sequentially, it builds up the final hash value that uniquely represents the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relation to other function**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses: expand_message_schedule() to create the 64-word message schedule, initialise_working_variables() to set up the working variables, and compress() to perform the 64-round transformation\n",
    "* Called by: The main sha256() function\n",
    "* Provides: Updated intermediate hash value for the next block or final output"

    "### **Problem 5 Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem examines a fundamental and widely exploited security weakness in password encryption: the use of unsalted cryptographic hash functions. Although SHA-256 is a secure and widely trusted cryptographic hash algorithm, if not used correctly for password storage, SHA-256 can leave systems vulnerable to offline attacks.\n",
    "In this scenario, three passwords have been hashed using a single application of the SHA-256 algorithm and stored without any additional protective mechanisms such as salting, key stretching, or multiple hashing rounds. The absence of these defenses significantly reduces the effort required to recover the original passwords, especially when users select weak or commonly used credentials. Three passwords have been hashed using a single pass of SHA-256 and stored without any additional security measures. This section of the notebook addresses the three following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cracking the passwords** - Determining the original passwords from their hashes\n",
    "2. **Explaining the method** - Documenting how the attack was performed\n",
    "3. **Suggesting improvements** - Recommended security measures to prevent such attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution will be implemented based on the information provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Three hashes of common passwords\n",
    "* The passwords were encoded using UTF-8 before hashing \n",
    "* Only one pass of SHA-256 was used\n",
    "* No salt or additional security measures were applied\n",
    "\n",
    "Something important to note is that unsalted passwords are deterministic, meaning that the same passwords always produce the same hashes.\n",
    "Given this information, the most logical solution to decrypting the three provided hashes is to apply a dictionary attack using the implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm shown in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionary attack** \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an attack which systematically tries common passwords from a predefined list (dictionary/wordlist) until finding a match. This exploits human tendency to choose:\n",
    "- Common words (\"password\", \"welcome\")\n",
    "- Simple patterns (\"123456\", \"qwerty\")\n",
    "- Personal information (names, dates)\n",
    "- Slight variations (\"password1\", \"P@ssw0rd\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, a dictionary attack will systematically test each entry from a predefined list of common passwords in order to decrypt the provided hashes. To do this, the following steps will be implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encoding each candidate password using UTF-8.\n",
    "* Hashing the encoded password using the same SHA-256 implementation (the one implemented in this notebook)\n",
    "* Comparing the resulting hash to the target hash\n",
    "* Identifying a match when the computed hash equals the stored hash\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the crack_password_hash() function is to recover a plaintext password from a given SHA-256 hash by performing a dictionary attack. It systematically hashes a list of commonly used passwords using the sha-256 algorithm implemented in previous sections, and compares each computed hash to the target hash. If a match is found, the corresponding plaintext password is returned.\n",
    "This function demonstrates how weak password choices and unsalted hashing make password hashes vulnerable to offline attacks, even when a cryptographically strong hash function such as SHA-256 is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function operates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: A counter 'attempts' is initialised to track how many password guesses have been tested. This provides insight into how quickly a password can be cracked using a small passwordList.\n",
    "* Step 2: The function loops through each password in the provided passwordList, treating each entry as a potential plaintext password.\n",
    "* Step 3: Each password string is encoded into UTF-8 bytes. This step is required because the SHA-256 hashing algorithm operates on byte data rather than Python strings\n",
    "* Step 4: The encoded password is hashed using a custom SHA-256 implementation developed earlier in the project. This ensures the hashing process exactly matches the one used to generate the target hashes.\n",
    "* Step 5: The computed hash is compared directly to the target hash. Because SHA-256 is deterministic and no salt was used, identical passwords will always produce identical hashes.\n",
    "* Step 6: If a match is found the function prints the number of attempts required and the plaintext password is returned immediately. If all candidate passwords are tested without finding a match the function reports the total number of attempts and returns 'None', indicating that the password was not found in the passwordList."

Although SHA-256 is cryptographically secure for integrity verification, it is not designed to resist high-speed brute-force or dictionary attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this type of attack, several improvements to password hashing should be implemented: \n",
    "\n",
    "* First, a unique cryptographic salt should be added to each password before hashing, ensuring that identical passwords produce different hashes and preventing the use of precomputed hash tables. \n",
    "* Second, key-stretching techniques such as multiple hashing iterations should be applied to significantly increase the computational cost of each password guess. \n",
    "* Finally, modern password-hashing algorithms specifically designed for this purpose—such as bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2—should be used, as they are intentionally slow and resistant to parallel attacks."

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of Achievement\n",
    "This project successfully implemented the complete SHA-256 cryptographic hash function by following the FIPS PUB 180-4 specification. Through five progressive problems, we constructed a working implementation that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Passes all official test vectors (verified against NIST standards)\n",
    "* Implements every specification detail (bitwise operations, constants, padding, compression)\n",
    "* Demonstrates cryptographic properties (avalanche effect, determinism, irreversibility)\n",
    "* Analyzes security implications (proper vs improper usage)\n",
    "* Provides educational value (comprehensive documentation and testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Problem 1: Cryptographic Primitives**\n",
    "We began with the smallest building blocks — individual bitwise operations that seem simple in isolation but combine to create complex, non-linear transformations. The rotation, choice, and majority functions taught us that security emerges from layering simple operations in specific ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key insight: Non-linearity is essential. Linear operations, no matter how many, can be reduced to a single linear operation. The Ch and Maj functions introduce irreducible complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Problem 2: Cryptographic Constants**\n",
    "By deriving 64 round constants from cube roots of prime numbers, we saw how transparency builds trust. These numbers can be independently verified by anyone, ensuring no backdoors exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key insight: In cryptography, trust comes from openness. Secret algorithms are vulnerable to hidden flaws; public algorithms withstand global scrutiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Problem 3: Message Preprocessing**\n",
    "Padding and parsing demonstrated that even data preparation involves security considerations. The specific padding scheme prevents extension attacks and ensures every message has a unique representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key insight: Security requires attention to every detail. The padding's length encoding isn't arbitrary—it's essential for preventing attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Problem 4: Hash Computation**\n",
    "The compression function revealed the heart of SHA-256: 64 rounds of carefully orchestrated operations that transform a 512-bit block into a 256-bit hash. Each round depends on previous rounds, creating a cascade of dependencies impossible to reverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key insight: Cryptographic strength comes from iteration. One round might be analyzable; 64 rounds create impenetrable complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Problem 5: Security Analysis**\n",
    "Password cracking exposed a crucial lesson: cryptographically secure does not equal secure for all purposes. SHA-256 is perfect for data integrity but dangerously inadequate for password storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key insight: Context matters. Using the right algorithm for the wrong purpose creates vulnerability, not security."
