All SHA-256 operations must use modulo 2^32 arithmetic to ensure consistent, reproducible hash values across all platforms and implementations- essentailly, all SHA operations must use unsigned 32-bit integers to produce correct hash values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Is Essential:** Python’s integers are unbounded by default, which would produce incorrect SHA-256 hashes. SHA-256 uses modulo 2^32 arithmetic for every operation which forces values into a 32-bit type. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correct overflow behavior: Values wrap around at 2^32−1 (4,294,967,295)\n",
    "* Proper masking: All values stay within 32-bit bounds\n",
    "* Platform consistency: Same results on all systems\n",
    "* Specification compliance: Matches FIPS 180-4 requirements exactly\n",

Essentially, for any integer x, applying modulo 2^32 means computing: x mod 2^32, which gives the remainder after dividing x by 2^32. The result is always in the range: 0 ≤ x mod 2^32 < 2^32\n",

Essentially, the Parity function determines whether an odd or even number of bits are set at each bit position across three 32-bit inputs.\n",

The Ch() function chooses bits from either of the two input integers y and z, based on the value of input x. Essentially, this function uses x as a selector to choose bits from either y or z: \n",

    "* if a bit in x is 1, then the corresponding bit from y is chosen\n",
    "* if a bit in x is 0, then the corresponding bit from x is chosen.\n",

    "* First, AND compares each bit in both values being considered and only outputs 1 when both bits are 1. If only one bit is 1 or neither bits are 1, a 0 is output. Therefore where x has 1s, the corresponding bits from y are output, and where x has 0s, 0s are output. \n",
    "* Next, When performing the AND operation on x and z, the NOT operation is first used to flip all the bits in x (1→0, 0→1). When AND is performed on (NOT)x and z, the bits where x orignally had 0s (now 1s) outputs the corresponding bits of z, and the bits where x originally had 1s (now 0s) outputs 0s. \n",

Therefore when XOR is applied, we get a binary number which shows which bits are different the results of both AND operations performed on x y and x z. However, due to the face that NOT was applied when calculating the result of x and z, but not when calculating the result of x and y, this results in the outputs of these operations being mutually exlusive - there is no overalp between the two: each result has 1s where the other has 0s and vice versa. So, in this situation, XOR simply acts like OR and combines the two results. XOR is used because...\n",

    "#### **rotr(x, n)** — Right Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** perform a right rotation on a 32-bit value. rort(x, n) rotates bits instead of shifting in zeros which isn a core operation in SHA-256’s mixing steps. rotr(x, n) is different from a logical shift because instead of bits being dropped once they go out of range, the rotation wraps around the dropped bits and adds them back onto the beginning of the vale. This preserves all bit information while performing a diffusion to improve encryption, which is the main function of rotr(x, n). Rotations are a core building block of the **Σ** and **σ** functions (implemented later in this section), so this helper function rotr(x, n) (shown below) implements rotations to facilitate these functions.\n",

    "###  Problem 3 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before hashing can begin, the message needs to be prepared in a specific way - everything needs to be the right size and format. This preparation has three steps, and we're focusing on the first two: padding and parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Padding the Message\n",
    "The goal: make the message length a specific multiple (either 512 bits or 1024 bits, depending on the SHA algorithm used).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For SHA-1, SHA-224, and SHA-256 (512-bit blocks):**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the message is ℓ bits long here's what happens:\n",
    "* Add a \"1\" bit to the end of your message\n",
    "* Add k zero bits, where k is chosen so that (ℓ + 1 + k) equals 448 when you divide by 512 and look at the remainder\n",
    "* Add a 64-bit representation of ℓ (the original message length)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The result: (ℓ + 1 + k + 64) is always 512 bits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parsing the Message\n",
    "\n",
    "Once padded, you need to break the message into chunks (blocks) for processing.\n",
    "For **SHA-256** and similar algorithms, you split your padded message into N blocks of 512 bits each. Each 512-bit block is then subdivided into sixteen 32-bit words (since 16 × 32 = 512).\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have block i, it contains words M₀⁽ⁱ⁾, M₁⁽ⁱ⁾, M₂⁽ⁱ⁾, ... M₁₅⁽ⁱ⁾."
